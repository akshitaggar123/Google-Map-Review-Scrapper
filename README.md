# Google-Map-Review-Scrapper
This is an simple program to Scrape All the Google Map reviews based on Place_id.
Basically, Google only allow to fetch only 5 reviews for free using their Google Maps API and charges you if you want all the reviws.
Hence, through this program,
you can fetch all the Google Maps reviews by Place_ids.
Since, Google Maps is a dynamic website hence, I have used automated testing tool. 
All the fetched reviews can be used to build  various Datasets/or can be used by local buisnesses to imporve their Performance.
